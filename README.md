## **Tools & Technologies Used**

•	SQL – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and standardization

•	Power BI – Data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation

•	CSV Mock Dataset – Primary data source for analysis


## **Business Problem Statement**

The company is experiencing an increasing number of refunded orders, negatively affecting overall profitability. However, the underlying causes, product category impact, and month-by-month refund behavior are not clearly understood.
The challenge is to consolidate messy raw data, calculate accurate refund metrics, and present insights that reveal why refunds occur, which categories are most affected, and how they impact profit.

## **Methodology**

1.	SQL query for data extraction , data cleaning , and transform the data from databases. 
2.	Connect the database to Power BI for a visualization and tracking of number and percentage per website use stages.


## **Results and Findings**
Refunds are primarily driven by product quality and description issues, such as “Not as Described”, “Wrong Item”, and “Damaged Item.”

Certain categories—especially Electronics and Clothing—show higher refund counts compared to others.

Monthly trends reveal recurring spikes, indicating operational or seasonal challenges.

Year-over-year comparison shows that 2025 refund amounts have increased, resulting in a higher share of profit loss.

The refund/return loss rate has a significant impact on overall net profit, highlighting the need for deeper quality control and customer feedback analysis.

## **Recomendations :**
Strengthen product quality checks before dispatch, especially for categories with high refund counts.

Improve product descriptions and images on sales platforms to reduce mismatches and "Not as Described" issues.

Review logistics and packaging processes to minimize damage-related returns.

Implement customer feedback loops to identify recurring product issues earlier.

Monitor monthly refund trends to proactively resolve operational inefficiencies during peak periods.
